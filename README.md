# NFL Overtime Markov Model

This repository holds a report I created in CSC 529 - Advanced Data Mining. In the report, I used a Markov model technique to see if a team should kick or receive after winning the coin flip in overtime based on scoring probabilites. This report takes into effect the new overtime rules that were implemented about five years ago.
